## ðŸ§¬ Project Structure

### Run Project

To run the project you have to pass some environment variables as described here: [How to Store API Keys in Flutter: --dart-define vs .env files](https://codewithandrea.com/articles/flutter-api-keys-dart-define-env-files/), in my case I opted for passing the key using `--dart-define` as it is easily integrated with CI/CD tools. This can be done in two ways:

* pass individual variables to the build command with `--dart-define MY_VARIABLE=value`, a choice that is later used in Netlify to create the release build
* pass a file with the variables with `--dart-define-from-file=api-keys.json`, a more convenient choice when developing locally

In the first case the command is:

```bash
flutter run --dart-define MY_VARIABLE=value
```

In the second case, on the other hand, you have to go and create a file called `api-keys.json` to put in the root of the project, with this content:

```json
{
  "MY_VARIABLE": "value"
}
```

and then pass it like this:

```bash
flutter run --dart-define-from-file=api-keys.json
```

Within the app you can then take the reference to the environment variable in this way:

```dart
const myEnvironmentValue = String.fromEnvironment('MY_VARIABLE');
```
